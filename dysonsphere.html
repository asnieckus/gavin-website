        <p>Before i get to telling you what a dyson sphere is let me tell you what a megastructure is. A megastructure is a very large man made structure. It is not clear how big something has to be to be a megastructure but things like the great wall of china are megastructures and if that is a megastructure a dysonsphere is one becuase is it so big that it will surround a star.</p>

        <p>Ok now that you know what a megastructure is let me tell you what a dyson sphere is. A dyson sphere is a megastructure that surrounds a star and collects a large amount of energy from the star. A dyson sphere would be better than just our solar panels because only a small amount of a stars energy emissions reach the earth so if it surrounds the star than it would collect the energy a lot better and it is way bigger so that would get so much more energy.</p>
        <br>
        <p>There are alot of other kinds of dyson spheres and i will be talking about the dyson swarm, the dyson shell, and the dyson net. First the dyson swarm is made of a bunch of independent constructs that are normally solar power satellites and space habitats that orbit around the star. The down side of the dyson swarm is that it is very complex and we will not be able to make it for a very long time. The dyson shell is a solid shell of matter around the star. The dyson shell would collect 100% of the stars output energy. The shell could also be used as a place for people to live. Lastly the dyson net is a web of cables that would surround the star and have heat collection units strung between the cables. </p>
