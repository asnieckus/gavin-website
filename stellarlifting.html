        <p>In the future there is an idea called stellar lifting. It is taking hydrogen fuel from the sun so that we can make it into more energy. The sun does it now because of solar wind and coronal mass ejections but just a little. What we need to do is speed it up. There are two ways that you could get it to speed up. First, we could use lasers to heat up parts of the surface and increase the volume of the solar wind. Second you could use magnetic fields to carry plasma away from the sun's poles into space. Once we have the energy we could combine it with oxygen and make energy with combustion. Or we could also put it in the space reactors and make energy with fusion. </p>

        <p>Also doing that could optimize the stars output energy and lifespan at the same time. If we do want to try this it would require  2.1 × 1000000000000 J/kg and using 10% of the suns power output would allow 5.9 × 1000000000000000000000 kilograms of matter to be lifted per year. That would be 0.0000003% of the suns mass or 8% of the moons mass. </p>
