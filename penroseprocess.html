    <p>The Penrose process is theorised by Roger Penrose. It means that energy can be extracted from a rotating black hole. But it can only be extracted if the rotational energy is in the ergosphere and not the event horizon. </p>

     <p>The Penrose process is saying that we can harvest 29% of the energy of a rotating black hole. To harvest the energy out of a rotating black hole you would have to is get a lump of matter to enter the ergosphere which is triggered to split into two parts becuase of the momentum of the two pieces when they split they have to be in a position so that one piece escapes from the black hole and the other one goes past the event horizon into the black hole. If arranged right  the escaping piece of matter can have greater mass/energy than it had in the beginning. </p>
