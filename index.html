  <div class="div" style="color:#00ffff;">There is more than one way that the human race can harvest energy from a star and I will be going over three of them. As the human race starts to need more energy and the stars have so much energy to give, and when the human race reaches stage two civilization, we will start to try to harvest stars, so how?</p>

    <p style="color:#00ffff">First let me tell you what the one, two, three, four, five and six stages of civilization are. Right now we are 7/10ths of the way to get to stage one civilization. We are at the point of getting to stage one in 100-200 years, but right now, we are not a stage one civilization yet because we do not have complete control of our planet. A stage one civilization is when the civilization can have complete control of their planet. A stage two civilization is when we can become an interplanetary civilization that can take control of total energy of a star. We will become a stage two civilization in about 1000-2000 years.</p> <br><p> A stage three civilization is going to  probably be in another stage of evolution where we are probably biological cibernetic beings. It would take about 100,000 years and we would have to have a whole galaxy worth of energy to be a stage three civilization. If a civilization is stage four then it has to be able to have the energy of the entire universe. When a civilization gets to stage five then they are so powerful that they would be able to do the same in the multiverse and take all of the energy from multiple universes. Stage six civilization is almost like being a god. The civilization would be able to control space and time creating universes at any time they want. There is a 7th stage of civilization but we can not even think of how powerful it would be.</p>
